# Co&Bart Restaurant App

This is the monorepo for a restaurant order system made by Co&Bart, a project group from S3-DB03 at Fontys ICT.

## Easy start

First, make sure to install dependencies for all frontend and backend projects.

Then, open git bash (or any bash compatible terminal) and run `bash start.sh`.

## Docs

The docs folder contains some general info about the project. We've also documented most of our decisions there. Individual frontend and backend docs are available in their respective folders.
