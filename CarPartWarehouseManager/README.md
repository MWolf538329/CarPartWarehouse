# SolidJS example

This is an example frontend with [SolidJS](https://docs.solidjs.com) and [SolidUI](https://www.solid-ui.com/docs/introduction) that uses the example backend.

## Installing dependencies

We use pnpm for package management. Install it with `npm i -g pnpm`.

Then install the dependencies with `pnpm i`.

Remember to never use normal npm with this project ever again. If you do, your node_modules will be fucked up severely. This isn't a threat, this is a fact. To save yourself you can `alias npm="echo 'no npm, only pnpm'"` and `alias npx="echo 'no npx, only pnpm npx'"` in your shell config. Alternatively, if you're lazy (as you should be), `alias npm=pnpm` and `alias npx=pnpm npx`.

## Running the app

Run `pnpm start` to start the app in development mode.
